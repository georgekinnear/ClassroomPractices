# Classifying classroom practices

In this project, we have developed a new tool, **FILL+**, for classifying classroom practices, and we are using this to do further research.

In October 2018, we were awarded [funding from the Principal's Teaching Award Scheme](https://www.ed.ac.uk/institute-academic-development/learning-teaching/funding/funding/previous-projects/year/october-2018/classroom-practices-and-lecture-recording) for this project.

## FILL+

FILL+ is the tool we have developed for classifying classroom practices.

## Reliable classification

We have used FILL+ to classify classroom practices in over 200 classes, and established that it can be applied reliably by novices after using the training manual.
