# FILL+ Training Guide

## Introduction to FILL+ 
FILL+ (Framework for Interactive Learning in Lectures) builds on the framework of Wood et al. (2016) by introducing 4 new codes: Administration (AD), Student Response (SR), Lecturer Response (LR) and Class Question (CQ). The objective of FILL+ is to serve as a classroom observation tool for characterising interactive activities in recorded lectures. The tool is based on a comprehensive ethogram which tries to exhaust the different activities which can occur in the class with regards to the lecturer and the students. By defining a series of ‘states’ the observer can chose which most appropriately reflects the situation in a second-by-second contiguous fashion. The codes are bound into three types of activity; interactive, non-interactive and vicarious interactive. This is such that the tool seeks to quantify the occurrence and duration of these three types of activity in each lecture.  

Following the same sociocultural approach as FILL, we focused on student experience when multiple activities occurred simultaneously i.e. the activity being experienced by the majority of students at that time was the activity that was recorded. 

### What is FILL+ suitable for 
In the broader research question of how teaching practices affect learning outcome it has become apparent a metric to measure in-class activities is needed (Wood et al. 2016). FILL+ is the latest development of the FILL tool (discussed in Wood et al. 2016) and is most suitable for characterising recorded lectures, rather than use in real time. 

### How to use this manual 
We would advise that you read through this manual, paying particular attention to the detail in Table 1 and then proceed to the ‘Video exercise’ section and watch the use of FILL+ in action (‘EverciseVideo_WithCommentary’), before having a go yourself.  

### How to use FILL+
The key to consistent and robust inter-rater reliability with FILL+ is a comprehensive and explicit ethogram in which the requirements for each state are clearly defined. The ethogram and codes needed for FILL+ is shown in Table 1.  

When watching a lecture the observer chooses the code for the state which most appropriately reflects the situation and records the time this state is initiated. A new code is only introduced (with a time stamp) when it was clear from the student perspective that a new activity was taking place. In instances where multiple codes occurred simultaneously, the activity that the majority of students are experiencing at that time is coded.

Note that all ‘states’ fall within three major categories; interactive, vicarious interactive and non-interactive. Each will be described subsequently, with examples following

#### Non-interactive 
This category includes types of states (given by codes ‘AD’ and ‘LT’ for administration and lecturer talk respectively) in which students may be listening and assimilating information but aren’t ‘interacting’ with it.

_Examples_
* ‘I will talk a little bit about the exam, how it functions and what resources are available to you’ (AD) 
* ‘ok, so, let’s start with a bit of notation. R this is the letter we use for the set of real numbers’’ (LT) 

#### Interactive 
FILL was essentially designed to capture and characterise the interactions in class between the lecturer and students, students with their peers and students with resources. Wood et al. (2016) describes that such interactions tended to fall into two categories; those which involved interactions amongst the majority of the class and those which involve interactions between a small subset of the class. As such, the category ‘interactive’ describes the former, in which the students are thinking about a question directed at the whole-class (CQ, class question) either individually (ST, student thinking) or by discussion with their peers (SD, student discussion). This category also includes the code feedback (FB) which describes a state in which the lecturer discusses the outcome of a response to a CQ (e.g. results from a clicker vote) where students (plural) have contributed to this response and, therefore, have invested interest in. Further, the correct answer is revealed in FB (though any explanation of why it is correct is LT) such that the students can complete the ‘loop’ of peer instruction with the correct answer.   

_Examples_
* ‘[shows CQ] So the question is what is the net magnetic flux passing through the Gaussian surface… have a bit of a think about that’ (CQ) 
* ‘93% of you thought C and you were absolutely correct’ (FB)
